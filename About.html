								<h5 class="h5">What is the importance of Mental Health Awareness?</h5>
							
									<p>
										Whether or not someone personally suffers with a mental health issue, Mental Health Awareness 
										helps people recognize the ways mental illness impacts their lives, educates people about 
										available services, and highlights ways to advocate.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Recognition and education are important ways to remove the stigma associated with mental illness.
										Mental Health Awareness creates a time and space to start a conversation. Talking openly about mental 
										health can reduce the misconceptions and stigma, and can encourage those who are suffering to seek help 
										and find a support network.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										It's important for caregivers, friends, and loved ones to understand the impact that mental health has on 
										daily life. Mental Health Awareness provides education about the reality of living with a mental health 
										condition - while it can make life more difficult, it doesn't have to stop someone from having a fulfilling life. 
										When people are better educated on these conditions, they can better support and help someone dealing with a mental 
										health issue.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Mental Health Awareness also provides an opportunity for fundraising, outreach, and awareness events.
										This, in turn, can help support research, fund treatment options, and connect advocates to create a brighter, more 
										promising future of mental health care.

									<h5 class="h5">Who can benefit from Mental Health Awareness?</h5>
									
									<p>
										Everyone! Mental Health Awareness helps those with a condition overcome the stigma and 
										get access to treatment. It helps their friends, family, and loved ones better understand their condition 
										and connect with support networks. It helps the providers who treat those with a condition receive funding 
										for their research and treatment so they can better care for all our mental health. In short, we can all 
										benefit from Mental Health Awareness.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										All mental health disorders benefit from receiving awareness. However, some are less familiar than others. 
										People still make jokes and take lightly the severity of these mental health disorders. This can cause 
										damage to those who suffer. Joking about mental health carries on the old stigmas mental health awareness 
										tries to dispel. Causing people to suffer in silence only carries on the negativity stigma pushes on people 
										who are struggling.
