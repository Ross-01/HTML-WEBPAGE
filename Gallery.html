							<h2>Childhood Abuse, Trauma, or Neglect</h2>
							
							<p>
								Child abuse and neglect may affect an individual's physical and mental health in both 
								direct and indirect ways. Maltreatment during infancy and early childhood has been 
								shown to negatively affect early brain development and in turn contribute to negative 
								behavioral health outcomes into adolescence and adulthood. The immediate emotional effects 
								of abuse and neglect—isolation, fear, and an inability to trust—can translate into lifelong 
								consequences, including poor mental health and behavioral health outcomes and increased risk 
								for substance use disorder.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Some long-term physical effects of abuse or neglect may 
								occur immediately (e.g., brain damage caused by head 
								trauma), but others can take months or years to emerge or 
								be detectable. There is a straightforward link between 
								physical abuse and physical health, but it is also important 
								to recognize that maltreatment of any type can cause 
								long-term physical consequences.

							<h2>Experiencing Discrimination and Stigma</h2>
							
							<p>
								Stigma is when someone sees you in a negative way because of a particular characteristic or 
								attribute (such as skin colour, cultural background, a disability or a mental illness). 
								When someone treats you in a negative way because of your mental illness, this is discrimination.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								Stigma happens when a person defines someone by their illness rather than who they are as an 
								individual. For example, they might be labelled ‘psychotic’ rather than ‘a person experiencing psychosis’.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								For people with mental health issues, the social stigma and discrimination they experience 
								can make their problems worse, making it harder to recover. It may cause the person to avoid 
								getting the help they need because of the fear of being stigmatised.

							<h2>Social Isolation or Loneliness</h2>
							
							<p>
								Loneliness is the feeling of being alone, regardless of the amount of social contact. Social isolation 
								is a lack of social connections. Social isolation can lead to loneliness in some people, while others 
								can feel lonely without being socially isolated.
							</p>
							<p>
								People who are lonely experience emotional pain. Losing a sense of connection and community can change 
								the way a person sees the world. Someone experiencing chronic loneliness may feel threatened and mistrustful 
								of others.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Social isolation and loneliness may also be bad for brain health. Loneliness and social isolation have 
								been linked to poorer cognitive function and higher risk for dementia, including and especially for 
								Alzheimer's disease. Also, little social activity and being alone most of the time may contribute to a 
								decline in the ability to perform everyday tasks such as driving, paying bills, taking medicine, and cooking.

							<h2>Severe or Long-term Stress</h2>
							
							<p>
								The body's stress response system is usually self-limiting. Once a perceived threat has passed, hormone levels 
								return to normal. As adrenaline and cortisol levels drop, your heart rate and blood pressure return to baseline 
								levels, and other systems resume their regular activities.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								But when stressors are always present and you constantly feel under attack, that fight-or-flight reaction stays 
								turned on.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The long-term activation of the stress response system and the overexposure to cortisol and other stress 
								hormones that follows can disrupt almost all your body's processes. This puts you at increased risk of many 
								health problems.

							<h2>Social Disadvantage, Poverty or Debt</h2>
							
							<p>
								Mental health is, to a great extent, shaped by the social, economic, and physical environments in which people live. 
								Inequalities in society are associated with a significant increased risk of mental ill health. Poverty is a key player.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								People in poverty can face constant, high levels of stress, for example due to struggling to make ends meet, 
								overcrowded or unsafe housing, fear of crime, and comparatively poor physical health. Poverty is clearly linked 
								with a number of mental health problems, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety, and substance misuse.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								It's a two-way street. Poverty can be both a cause and a consequence of mental ill health, e.g. where 
								debilitating symptoms and stigma around mental illness have an impact on a person’s income and ability to work
