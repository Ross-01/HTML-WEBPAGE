							<h2>When Mental Illness Shuts Down our Minds</h2>
							
							<p>We should – as much as possible – stop all mental activity and rest. We might listen to music, 
								have a long bath, watch something untaxing on television and perhaps take a calming pill. We should 
								also try to plug our brain into that of someone else, to benefit from their greater powers of reason.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Living with mental illness is not easy. It’s a consistent problem without a clear solution. While 
								treatments like medication and psychotherapy are incredibly helpful, sometimes people experiencing 
								mental health conditions need to do more day-in and day-out to feel good or even just okay.
								Some common self-help suggestions people receive are to exercise, meditate and be more present, 
								which are helpful and work for many people. However, other proven methods aren’t mentioned as often. 
								Many of them are quick and simple techniques that can easily be added to daily routines.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Finding the right coping mechanism takes time and patience, but it can enormously impact how you feel. 
								If you haven’t had success with techniques you’ve tried, or you’re looking to add a few more to your 
								toolkit, here are seven coping mechanisms recommended by mental health professionals worth trying out.

							<h2>How to Cope with Depression</h2>
							
							<p>
								There are a range of ways to deal with depression, and often they are best used in conjunction 
								with each other. The top medical options are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), antidepressant 
								medication, and in some severe cases, Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). Psychoeducation is also 
								important when learning to manage your depression. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Taking the first step is always the hardest. But going for a walk or getting up and dancing to your 
								favorite music, for example, is something you can do right now. And it can substantially boost your 
								mood and energy for several hours—long enough to put a second recovery step into action, such as 
								preparing a mood-boosting meal or arranging to meet an old friend. By taking the following small but 
								positive steps day by day, you’ll soon lift the heavy fog of depression and find yourself feeling happier, 
								healthier, and more hopeful again.

							<h2>How to Improve your Mental Health</h2>
							
							<p>
								Faith, empowerment, and autonomy are the goals of recovery, which is a personal process. 
								Recovery is often achievable for many persons suffering from mental illnesses.
							</p>
							<p>
								Many variables contribute to healing, including having a strong support network comprised of
								individuals you like, respect, and trust. They can be family members, friends, instructors,
								spiritual leaders, neighbors, or peers – what matters is that you have individuals with whom 
								you feel comfortable discussing your feelings and seeking assistance.

							<h2>How to Ask for Help</h2>
							
							<p>
								If you notice these changes in your or a loved one’s behaviors, especially if you’ve answered 
								“yes” to some of the questions above, it’s important to reach out for support as soon as possible. 
								The longer someone goes without treatment, the more serious symptoms may become—and, in the case of 
								symptoms like delusions or self-injury, untreated symptoms can have serious consequences to your health.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first step in getting help is talking to an adult you trust, like a parent or caregiver, teacher, 
								guidance counselor, or doctor. Especially if you’re still in school, it’s important to seek help from 
								a trusted adult, because they can help you find the mental health resources you need, like a counselor 
								or therapist. If you are ready for a conversation but don’t know who to turn to,

							<h2>How to Get Out of a Despairing Mood</h2>
							
							<p>
								There’s no plug and play solution for transforming despair. Your subconscious, creative, problem-solving 
								mind takes time to process properly.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Be patient. You don’t need all the answers right now—just some starter fluid to get your brain thinking. 
								As with any creative process, the first answers won’t be your best.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Once you’ve cleared your mind, absorbed input from a trusted resource, and eased into daydreaming, you 
								can start making some changes in your life.
