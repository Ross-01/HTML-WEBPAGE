							<h2>Introduction to Mental Health</h2>
							
							<p>
								What is mental health? Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
								It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, 
								and make healthy choices.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Mental health determines how you think, feel and act. Good mental health is when you feel positive 
								about yourself and cope well with the everyday pressures. If you experience issues dealing with 
								everyday problems, it could be a sign of a mental health problem and should be addressed immediately.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders 
								that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, 
								schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.

							<h2>Take Care of your Mental Health</h2>
							
							<p>When your mental health suffers, it can become hard to enjoy life. You may start to feel run down, 
								both mentally and physically. Many of these changes can make it harder to enjoy a balanced and rewarding 
								life. Everyone can benefit from learning how to enhance and protect their mental health—whether or not 
								hey’ve experienced mental illness or a substance use problem.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Our mental health has a tremendous impact on our overall health and well-being. Our mental health 
								includes our thoughts, emotions, feelings and moods. It influences our choices, actions and how we 
								relate to others. Good mental health can help us cope with stress, succeed in our professional lives,
								more effectively recover from difficult situations and add value to our community and be our best self.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Mental health is an important part of overall health and wellness. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
								Mental health plays a big role in how we handle stress, relationships and emergencies.

							<p>Sometimes things can seem overwhelming, and it can feel like you can’t cope. You may simply just be 
								having a bad day, or you may have an ongoing mental health problem that needs support. The important 
								thing is not to try to cope on your own.

								When you’re struggling, it’s not good to spend too much time alone, especially if you are feeling low and vulnerable. It’s at times 
								like these that you need to be able to talk to someone. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.
							</p>
							
							<br>
							
							<p>
								Even if you’re feeling completely alone right now and that you have nowhere to turn or that nobody cares, you are not alone. There are 
								lots of amazing helplines and online services (listed at the bottom of this page) where you can get 
								support from trained professionals who really do care and want to help you through it.
							</p>
							
							<br>
							
							<p>
								Just because you’re ready to have a conversation, it doesn’t mean it will be convenient at that moment for the other person. This doesn’t m
								ean they don’t care about you. Keep in mind that just as others may not realize everything that’s 
								going on with you, you also don’t know what may be on their minds at the moment.
							</p>
							
							<br>
							
							<p>
								Explain what it is you’ve been experiencing – changes in your thoughts, feelings, behaviors, sleep, energy and mood. You might tell them you’ve 
								been feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or depressed, or like your usual coping strategies are barely 
								working any more. You might also tell them that you’ve been “not feeling like your usual self,” 
								or that you’re “having thoughts that are troubling to you.” (Keep in mind that it works both ways: 
								just as situational stress can impact our mental health, sometimes our mental health can affect the 
								way we are coping with a situation.)
